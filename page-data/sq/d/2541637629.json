Users may also share events and guides with other users of the application.\n\nTo use the application, users must sign up for an account or login using a pre-existing account, using an email and password. Firebase Authentication will handle the login process. User account information, event information, and guide information are stored in a Firebase cloud database.\n\nAfter logging in, users are able to update their profiles, view open classrooms, share guides, and participate in events. Joined events are displayed on the Calendar tab and main dashboard for quick access. The event locations are displayed using OpenStreetMap API.\n\nFull-in-depth overview and set up guide can be found on the Github link."}},{"node":{"title":"Expendable Employees","project_type":[{"name":"React Project"},{"name":"Web Development"}],"item_category":"software","tags":[{"name":"React"},{"name":"Material UI"},{"name":"Javascript"},{"name":"HTML"},{"name":"CSS"},{"name":"MongoDB"},{"name":"NodeJS"}],"slug":"expendable-employees","source":"https://github.com/Nycarus/expendable-employees/tree/main/expendable-employees","images":[{"image":{"publicURL":"/anthonyhuang.ca/static/9f8e2ba346bf7e5273ee4d200ed35102/schedule.png"}},{"image":{"publicURL":"/anthonyhuang.ca/static/af6dac145bf21e85cbbaeaf5ecc62df8/employees.png"}},{"image":{"publicURL":"/anthonyhuang.ca/static/690c7fd033bfa36dede323880afbc9f5/mail.png"}},{"image":{"publicURL":"/anthonyhuang.ca/static/a681686d57d7b4e723c6533965ffd6ed/profile.png"}}],"videos":[],"format_type":"standard-project","status":"complete","description":"A Managerial Tool web application for managing your employees, but with a small twist.

The project is split into five phases and was made with two separate teams. The first team consisted of three members, including myself, and the second team consisted of four members, including myself. The first team developed the front end of the application, as well as integration and unit testing for the front end. The second team developed the back-end of the application, as well as the unit-testing of the back-end.\n\nPhase 1-3:\n\nThe front end of the system was created using C++. The program allows users to perform actions with their bank account. Actions include:\n\n- login\n- logout\n- withdraw\n- transfer\n- paybill\n- deposit\n- create\n- delete\n- disable\n- changeplan\n\nThe program will display instructions and transactions that can be carried out upon typing the action. Certain actions, such as delete, disable, and changeplan, can only be accessed by an admin user. All transactions performed will be recorded in a text file and will be eventually sent to the back-end for processing by the end of the day.\n\nThe front end is tested using shell scripts. Each transaction has several unit test cases for each interaction. When run, the output of the application, provided with an input text file, will be compared with an expected output. Upon finishing the script, each unit test will be recorded onto a text file, displaying the cases that have passed and the cases that have failed.\n\nPhase 4-5\n\nThe back-end of the system was created using Java and is tested using JUnit, similarly to phases 1-3. The program processes the transaction file, created by the front end, and will make changes to the accounts of the users at the end of the day, using a process involving master account files and account files."}},{"node":{"title":"Pygame Brick Breaker","project_type":[{"name":"Pygame Project"}],"item_category":"software","tags":[{"name":"Python"},{"name":"Pygame"}],"slug":"pygame-brick-breaker","source":null,"images":[{"image":{"publicURL":"/anthonyhuang.ca/static/5eed82716f800c116edceb59dbb47fe4/brick_breaker.png"}}],"videos":[{"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGGx1bBVx3g","title":"Pygame Brick Breaker"}],"format_type":"standard-project","status":"complete","description":"Pygame Brick Breaker is a brick breaker game built using Pygame and Python 2.7.
