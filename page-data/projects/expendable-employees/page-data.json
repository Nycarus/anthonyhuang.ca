To access the application, a user must register a company and create an account. From there, the creator will be made an admin and they may add or manage employees, change their schedules, fire a random non-admin employee, etc. Users within the company may send messages, make events, and manage work schedules. User account information are stored in a MongoDB database.\n\nUser authentication for validation, login credentials, and priviledges are handle using JSON Web Tokens. Before certain data are stored in the MongoDB database, the data is salted and hashed using bycrpt. Schema Validation is also used to ensure that the data being processed and stored remain consistent."}},"pageContext":{"slug":"expendable-employees"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
